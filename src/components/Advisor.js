          <h1>The Firm</h1>
          <p>
            Armis Financial was founded due to the lack of transparency and
            value that the financial service industry currently provides to
            clients. After years of working at a large financial service firm as
            a financial advisor, I began to see flaws in my industry. Financial
            advisors are often taught to seek as many clients as possible,
            aggressively sell investment products, or push you towards their
            “fee-based” solutions. There is nothing wrong with selling an
            investment product if it’s truly in the client’s best interest.
            Practically every firm starts by gathering all your information and
            filling out a simple survey or questionnaire that gauges your
            “tolerance to risk.” Afterward, the firm pushes mutual funds or
            their own proprietary funds as the best “solution” for your
            investment goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a reason why most firms do it this way and why their
            Investment Policy Guidelines are similar— it is a marketing gimmick
            to get your money invested right away to either generate commission
            or get a kickback for services they recommend. Although everything I
            said might sound demeaning towards the financial service industry, I
            do believe most financial advisors provide value and have the
            client’s best interests in mind, but lack an efficient system or
            platform in place to prove it. Additionally, it is often hard to
            recommend an appropriate solution because the firm, client, and
            advisor’s interest might intertwine.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any of the issues mentioned above sound familiar, feel free to
            reach out. Armis Financial offers comprehensive financial advice and
            asset management services to individuals, businesses, and families
            across the country from our home base in Austin, Texas. My mission
            is to partner up with clients and help them build a financial plan
            during their accumulation, preservation and transferring phases of
            life—all while being prudent, objective and tailored towards their
            goals.

          <h1>What Makes Us Different</h1>
          <h3>Intentional</h3>
          <p>
            As we mentioned before, most advisors are taught to seek as many
            clients as possible. But how can they find the time to provide value
            and adequately serve the client well? At Armis Financial, we believe
            that less is more. We intentionally work with select individuals
            that don’t want to be just another number. Our clients have to be
            comfortable with our philosophy, our fees and the value we provide.
            That is the only way we can have a tremendous impact on people’s
            lives. The result is a happy client which in turn makes us happy as
            well.
          </p>
          <h3>Fee-Only (When Winning)</h3>
          <p>
            Armis Financial is devoted to helping you succeed by providing
            personalized care while having the resources and knowledge of a
            large firm. “Fee-only” means you, and only you pay us. There is no
            incentive to the advice we recommend, nor do we get a commission for
            the trades we place. To keep clients’ interests and objectives at
            the forefront of the service we provide, we feel that the “fee-only”
            method is the only method that separates honest advice from
            conflicting advice. Oh, did we forget to mention that you only pay
            if you are winning? Learn more about what I mean by “When Winning”
            and about the difference between “fee-based” and “fee-only.”
          </p>
          <h3>Goal Oriented</h3>
          <p>
            Every individual has their own set of particular goals—whether its
            retirement, saving for kid’s education, buying a home, or just
            beating the benchmark. Before we make a recommendation, we always
            make sure the money you worked hard for is also working hard to meet
            your long-term or short-term goal—while aligning with your proper
            risk-profile and time-horizon.
          </p>
          <h3>Interactive Brokers</h3>
          <p>
            One of the other ways Armis Financial is different is by making the
            executive decision to partner with Interactive Brokers, LLC to
            become our custodian. Clients assets are not held at Armis
            Financial. We chose to work with IB for a variety of reasons:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Financial Stability: During the Financial Crisis, IB actually
              received an upgrade from various rating agencies due to their
              sound financial status.
            </li>
            <li>
              Access and Execution: Complete access to all electronically traded
              markets worldwide while offering the one of the fastest trading
              execution of all online brokers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Less conflict of interest: After extensive due diligence, we chose
              IB platform because they offer no incentive to recommend any fund
              over the other. Most institutional custodian firms have their own
              proprietary fund that are highly incentivized. If your advisor
              recommends a fund that has the name of the firm in it, I would
              question the reason.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fees and Expenses: IB’s fee structure and commission is among the
              lowest of all the institutional brokerage firms.
            </li>
            <li>
              True Short Exposure: All though only recommended if deemed
              appropriate, IB has the ability to buy and sell alternative
              investments such as options, futures, volatility in an IRA account
              which provides our firm to have “true short exposure” in qualified
              accounts.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Here is a list of accolades that Interactive Brokers ave received in
            the past couple of years.
          </p>
          <h3>No Mutual Funds</h3>
          <p>
            Armis Financial offers a new kind of advice that doesn’t follow the
            outdated norm, and that is tailored to your values and goals. That
            advice is to stay away from mutual funds. They are not only an
            ineffective way to invest, but they also have an enormous amount of
            hidden costs that can range up to 1.5% on top of the expense ratio
            (1.25% Industry Average), then there is the fee that you pay the
            Advisor. You are paying these fees regardless of how your investment
            is doing. Armis Financial wants to lighten your load, not pile on.
            There are better ways to be fully diversified while not sacrificing
            returns and cutting your cost. Meaning more money in your pocket.

            portfolio before it is too late.
